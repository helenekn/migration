         <p class="text__descr descr">
            When you make the decision to move to a different country with your
            family, you’re looking for the perfect place to call home. Every
            person and every family has their own perception of what an ideal
            place to live looks like. While some people prefer to live by the
            beach, others prefer the mountains. You may long to live in a quiet
            little village, while others enjoy the bustling life of the city.
            So, why do thousands of families choose Cyprus as their ultimate
            destination? Because this island has it all! Everything is in close
            proximity, enabling you to discover every hidden aspect of the
            island. The Cypriot lifestyle embraces people of all ages and
            backgrounds. Laid-back lifestyle: The Mediterranean way of life
            comes to contradict the tiresome and stressful life in larger cities
            and countries. Low pollution levels: Striving to become even more
            environmentally-friendly, Cyprus’s air quality is high. Stunning
            beaches: One of the most obvious reasons people move to Cyprus is
            the ability to live by some of the most magical and turquoise
            beaches of the world. The fantastic Cypriot weather: Cyprus's
            climate is considered one of the healthiest in the world, with over
            300 days of sunshine annually. Average winter temperatures are
            13-15°C, and summer temperatures are 30-33°C. It doesn’t take long
            to be captivated by the mesmerizing Cypriot lifestyle. All of these
            advantages makes the decision to relocate much easier.

               Answer: In comparison to other countries of the EU, the cost of
               living is relatively low. Of course, the cost of living varies
