         <p class="text__descr descr">
            A minimum of around 4 million tourists choose Cyprus as their
            holiday destination per year. This makes the island one of the most
            popular destinations in the world. In fact, many people who
            experience life in Cyprus tend to return either for another holiday
            or decide to move permanently. As a business entrepreneur looking to
            relocate, the most essential point to carefully consider is the new
            location of your business activities. This is why apart from the
            outstanding business advantages of Cyprus, you can also find the
            ideal location for you and your employees to work and live. The cost
            of living is lower than in most other EU countries High quality of
            living for expatriates: there are thousands of expat communities
            around the island Low crime rate: one of the safest countries to
            live globally Exceptional healthcare facilities Among the world's
            top retirement destinations One of the best state pension systems

            The decision to relocate your business comes with the need to
            discover a location with a strong and promising economic future for
            your business. Cyprus has established its resilient economic
            reputation with one of the fastest growth rates in the EU. This is
            achieved by focusing on the diversification of services and business
            opportunities found on the island. Some of the most dominant
            services include communications, real estate, and financial
            industries. The government’s efforts to support businesses has
            proved fundamental in the growth of the economy. Robust GDP growth

            foreign businesses to Cyprus for the purpose of creating or
            expanding their operations. This creates unlimited possibilities
            when it comes to growing your business in Cyprus.
